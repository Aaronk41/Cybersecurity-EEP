# Week4

- DDoS detection and blocking script  
- Multi-threaded honeypot simulating SSH and HTTP services  
- ZIP file password cracker using a wordlist

## Information

In Week 4, I developed a DDoS test script that monitors and blocks IPs exceeding request limits. I also built a honeypot running SSH and HTTP fake services to log and analyze incoming connection attempts. Additionally, I created a ZIP password cracker that attempts to unlock archives using a wordlist. Alongside these projects, I completed several LinkedIn learning modules to further enhance my skills.
