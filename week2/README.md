# Week2

- Java project demonstrating five vulnerabilities:  
  SQL Injection, Command Injection, Hardcoded Credentials, IDOR, and XSS.  
- Python keylogger with email reporting.  
- Python hash cracker supporting MD5, SHA1, and SHA256.  
- Python Caesar cipher tool with encryption, decryption, and brute-force.

## Information

In Week 2, I worked on a Java project containing five classes, each representing a different common vulnerability. Additionally, I created Python scripts: a keylogger that logs keystrokes and emails the report, a hash cracker that attempts to find plaintext passwords from hashed inputs using a wordlist, and a Caesar cipher tool allowing encryption, decryption, and brute-force decryption of texts. Alongside these projects, I completed several LinkedIn learning modules to further enhance my skills.
