# Week1

Worked on a kill-chain mermaid diagram and a password strength checker.

## Information

For Week 1, I created a kill-chain diagram using Mermaid to visualize attack stages. I also built a password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on length, character types, and whether they appear in a common password list like rockyou.txt. The checker categorizes passwords as Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong.
