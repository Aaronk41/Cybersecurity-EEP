## Information
In Week 6, I studied various password attack methods and visualized them using Mermaid.js.
I integrated this work into the PyShield Antivirus project as part of the documentation and educational material. This included visual breakdowns of brute force, phishing, and credential stuffing techniques to support awareness and detection. I also continued my learning by working through course on Coursera to enhance my skills and knowledge.
