# Week 9

## Tasks
- Dragon Quest RPG SQL database project  
- Pokémon Pokedex SQL queries  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention notes  
- Pasta Types flowchart  

## Summary
This week I worked on two SQL projects: building a Dragon Quest RPG database and writing queries for a Pokémon Pokedex. Both helped me get better at designing databases and writing SQL. I also put together a simple guide on preventing XSS attacks, based on OWASP recommendations. To finish, I made a flowchart showing different types of pasta, practicing data visualization with Mermaid and worked on Coursera quizzes.
