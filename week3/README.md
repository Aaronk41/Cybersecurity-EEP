# Week3

- Python port scanner  
- Python HTTP packet sniffer  
- OWASP Top 10 and Defense-in-Depth Mermaid diagrams  
- C# Robot Control System with multiple classes for motor control, navigation, sensors, and main program

## Information

During Week 3, I developed a Python port scanner that scans a range of ports on a target IP using multithreading for speed. I also built an HTTP packet sniffer that captures and decodes HTTP requests on the network with optional filtering and packet limits. Additionally, I created Mermaid diagrams visualizing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and defense-in-depth strategies. Finally, I worked on a C# Robot Control System project consisting of multiple classes managing motors, navigation, sensors, and the main program logic. Alongside these projects, I completed several LinkedIn learning modules to further enhance my skills.
