# Week 8

## Tasks
- Keylogger Analyzer GUI project  
- Created sample_log.txt for testing  
- Linux Security Audit script  
- IDS Mermaid Diagram visualization  
- Continued Coursera Cybersecurity coursework  

## Information
In Week 8, I developed a Keylogger Analyzer GUI from learning more about CUI and CLI in Coursera. I crealted a Keylogger to parse and analyze logs, enhancing my skills in Python and cybersecurity tool development.  
I also created a sample log file to test the analyzer effectively.  
Additionally, I wrote a Linux Security Audit script to automate gathering system information for security assessments.  
I visualized an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Mermaid diagrams to better understand network security architectures.  
Throughout the week, I continued progressing through my Coursera Cybersecurity course to further strengthen my knowledge.
