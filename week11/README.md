## Summary
This week, I worked on several projects spanning data science, cybersecurity, and game development. I updated the README for the Airbnb Price Prediction Japan model and added a .gitignore to the C2 Server Simulator project.

I also developed a Dragon Ball-themed CapsuleCorp Fake Login Portal and Galactic Database, enhancing my web and database skills. Additionally, I created a Pokedex app that uses camera input to train the model, and built a 2D Python game called Shichi Tama, where players answer questions to collect seven orbs.

Finally, I worked on a URL Phishing Detector project, strengthening my knowledge of phishing detection techniques.
