# Week 10

## Tasks
- Mini Vulnerability Scanner 
- Pokémon Type Predictor (README updated)  
- Cybersecurity Threats mind map (Mermaid)  
- Incident Response Lifecycle visualization (Mermaid)  

## Summary
This week, I developed a Python-based mini vulnerability scanner on Kali Linux that identifies open ports and services, strengthening my scripting and network security skills. I also worked on the Pokémon Type Predictor project by updating the README and refining the prediction model.
To support my cybersecurity studies, I created two Mermaid diagrams: one summarizing common cybersecurity threats and another illustrating the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle. These visualizations helped me better understand key concepts and improved my documentation abilities.
