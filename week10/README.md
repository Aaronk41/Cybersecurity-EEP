# Week 10

## Tasks
- Mini Vulnerability Scanner 
- Pokémon Type Predictor 
- Cybersecurity Threats mind map
- Incident Response Lifecycle visualization 

## Summary
This week, I developed a Python-based mini vulnerability scanner on Kali Linux that identifies open ports and services, strengthening my scripting and network security skills. I also worked on the Pokémon Type Predictor project by updating and refining the prediction model.

To support my cybersecurity studies, I created two Mermaid diagrams: one summarizing common cybersecurity threats and another illustrating the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle. These visualizations helped me better understand key concepts and improved my documentation abilities.
